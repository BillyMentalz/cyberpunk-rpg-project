5The crumbling of nations led to a bleeding of tech companies nurtured under their watch. Many of which eventually released their know how to the world and others being acquired and merged into the wings of one of the Conglomerates, who jealously kept the know how from even the people who worked under them. 
The technology of the comglomerates were at times incredibly remarkable especially compared to their counterparts built entirely by volunteering work. 


### AI 
AI models are to some extent duplicable and can be fine-tuned, but the industrial complex used to gather the data necessary has all but lost. The large databanks containing all the data of the human race have all been corrupted beyond repair. Legend are there data center cut off at the last second, fully autonomus with nuclear power plants to support the maintenance. 

AI agents can be found and duplicated, but new ones can no longer be made. Banks of outdated knowledge and hallucinating minds. 

### 64-bit CPUs 
The art of manufacturing high-fidelity was guarded by a jealous few, and the supply chain to creat those have long been corroded. The only company still around to make these company is the Yveta conglomerate, seated in the heart of Prague. It leverages it's highly automated supply chain as the only manufacturer of chips

Due to the various difficulties in the high prutiy products, Many have reverted back to the 32-bit system, which can be produced by a few hundred people as opposed to thousand, with less of a demand on fidelity. Because of the the larger size of the transistor, modern comptuer chips are bulky cubes with a large heat signature. 

### GPUs
In a world where high-end graphics are no longer necessary, many producers ended up making tensor processing units in the tail end of the [[(1%) The United Century]] . High graphic gaming became a thing of the past, causing a resurgence in retro games.
