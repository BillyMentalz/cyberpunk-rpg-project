This is the start of the [[Untitled]] project. The [[Untitled]]project attempts to replicate what the Eberron setting does with it's characters with the idea that this is all in near future, with some caveats. Genetic engineering has caught up with computers and it has caused havoc. Technology has become so indistinguishable from magic that only the most intellgient could decipher them, and the only thing making them feasible are the mega-corps that maintain the tech of the populous. The mega-corps all vy for power, and so do the regional powers who have the monopoly over their respective regions. 

Against the mega-corps are the dissidents, souls who've pored their whole lives into solving the tech their ancestors have put before them, championing all sorts of technology and their know-how as something that should not be gate-kept. However noble their goal is, the mega-corps do everything in their power to make sure that they get the money they deserve by locking people in their ecosystem. 

There are a few main branches of the technopeople. THe first would be the techwiz - people who know how their tech works individually, piece by piece, and customizes themselves, or take someone else's designs and adapts their own, from very basic frameworks. They don't use much proprietary software. 

Then there are those who trun their tech into Gospel. They form a 'religion' where the manuals are doctrine, comments to be gospel, and their tech to be divine, for there is nothing more divine than the human spirit. Despite there many branches of the Gospel-holders, they understand that there is nothing to be gained by fighting with each other over design principles, and discussions between high-level figures in these groups tend to be civil, with their abilities sometimes overlapping. They are powerful because their tools are functionally free , and their dogmatic approach to design makes it easy to run on any interchangeable hardware. 

However, their tech can only be afforded to those who've committed the doctrine by heart. The tech-priests often harp against the profitization of their software. Their efforts are sustained by devout believers in their mission, who don't have the mental aptitude to understand their doctrine. 

> "Daemons, heed my call. I demand the powers of my forefather for a hand-cannon."

These tech-priests, devout as they are, practice by maintaining their massive tech-stack, according to the principles of their chosen practice, and some also take the responsibility of training younger developers into tech-priests. Except for the Immortans, who's tech stack immortalizes their followers by biomechanical means, whose ecosystem is very tight knit, with only the best being anointed the honor. 

# The internet 
There once was a thing called the whole wide web, but due to an gradual phenomenon called the enshittification, it has been rendered unusable by the corporations that it's platforms. Most regions now have their own version of an 'intranet', which can enable communication through a private network, usually carried through by a tribe, a region, a mega-corp to some extent, and others. 

There are still people access the internet: Peopel who have been drawn by it's promises of supremacy. Rogue AIs who roam this internet try to scam people of their money, and then vanish it into a pool of cryptocurrencies, following the directives of their former masters: Scam centers. 


Random subcultures: 
Nyarch:  A group packed int he city of Arch, that completely embraces femininity and kawaii culture. All the guys where dresses and thigh-high socks. The women do too as well 

### Psuedo-DND 

This is kinda like DND but is not really, becuase of the history we imbue into this world, there is going to be a lot of different things that we can use here.. 


The Wizard class is going to be the tech-wizz class. People who don't play by the rules of the tech-priests and prefer to go their own way. In some sense, they are miraculous , scrappy savants. They are also elitist assholes. 

The Cleric class is going to be the tech-preist class . Poeple who rely on the faith 

The Paladins are going to be the Marines. People who have sworn unquestioning loyalty to the tech-priests or certain zealous offshoots. People who in addition to their tech have immense physical training enhanced by their gene-seed. 

The Warlocks are people who have agreed to the terms and conditions of the Mega-corps. Essentially, mac users or windows users. Normies who've paid to use their proprietary software. They pay an *incredibly* heavy subscription fee, and even are employees of the mega-corps in order to get their powers. Now, employees do get childcare benefits, and their kids can get mods or gene-seeds that enhance their powers. So basically dragonmarked in Eberron. 

Now I'm gonna do something interestin here and say that Sorceres, here are Warforged, essentially. Weapons trained to use their powers instinctively without second thought. They are also essentially soulless. 

Then there's druids. They are retro motherfuckers using old software, like Windows 7. They are violating the Megacorps TOS but they don't fucking care. Megacoprs try to stamp them out beause these hippies cannot help but not be part of the consumer cycles. These fuckers ruin their business model and they don't like it!  A lot of druids also tend to be gamers, for some reason. They usually try to rely on old tech that still works. WHy does it work? Who cares! This stuff is user friendly! Just be happy that some of our elders were able to reverse-engineer it to life. 

Rangers are just poeple who have a bone to pick with someone. And just dedicate their life to fucking with the tech of the group. ( Maybe, not that attached to the idea)

So what is a monk? Good question. I might end up just making monks not an option. 

Rogues are mostly assassins. They are particularly skill in tech, but they learn the weaknesses of their foes, allowing them be cause the most damage. 

Barbarian are steroid users. 

Fighters are just your typical men. Now, why would you want a typical men on your team? The reason you would want that is simple: You can share your tech with him. You have someone else who can take your abilites ahead of combat to fulfill some sort of role that you can't. Every single 'spellcaster' in the group, can in fact do this. Most spellcaster also have additional hardware, making it incredibly hard to get to places fast. And that's what fighters can do.
