### The story of the 30-year exile.
Some say that the New Religion Movement started here, with the popularization of the Father religion (working title). However, the local government saw it as a threat to the state religion, and declared it a heretical organization. With the arrests of fellow members of the religion, the Founder, and their 2000 disciples, exiled themselves from the city. 

50 years, the very governemtn that cast them out moved their capital, or they simply petered of relevance, or they were overthrown by a violent mob. Whatever it is, the founder could have styaed in the exile camp, but he made a decision to move back to Cloud Central. After a completely reintegration taking 6 years time, the founder retired for 1 year, before his death soon after, and his grave buried in the central grave of the city. The tale of the 30-year exile has been enshrined into canon.
