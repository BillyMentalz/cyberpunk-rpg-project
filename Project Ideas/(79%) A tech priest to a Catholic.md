"You steal our colors and for what! You don't even believe in God! Take off these sheets! Take them off!" 

"No. I deserve these sheets more than you. That I'm certain. You dare look - don't look at me with that indignant face! You believe in a mirthless joyless being who watches over you with fake pity in his heart! I apologize, if I want to believe in something real. To believe that somewhere in the world, a child picks up a Ordian laptop and learn the secrets of the world. To believe that my brethen has spent countless hours to ensure my armor works without fail. To believe that there is nothing more divine than human selflessness and the dream of a better future. You! You claim that you God has a larger, overarching plan, well so do I! And it's documented, personally written with precise instructions and backlogged over thousands of servers. My gospel tells me why my gear fails, why my machines go weary and why the ghosts of my dreams are not my fault. And what does YOUR GOD tell YOU."
