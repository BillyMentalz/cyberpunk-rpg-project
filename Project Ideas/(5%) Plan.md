# Phases 
My current plan is to keep writing solo until I can get more poeple on board, with some ideas on how to expand this project before the end of Curse of Strahd, which is my current campaign. 

### Vertical slice
Writing, and just writing, and just writing. Keep adding lore entries, until there is some sort of a vertical slice. 

1. Make clear the general outline of the history of the world, based on [[Design Principles]] 
	1. How long did the War last? Who fought it? - There was no war, just a slow, ambling collapse of society. 
	2. What was the aftermath of the war? - Again, there was no war, just a gradual shift of human culture from hegemony to a slow dissolution. HUamntiy is now scattered,, as they always have been, following the collapse of the biggest human experiment ever, to connect everyone, ended up connecting no one. 
	3. Do governments still exist? They still clai to exist - but their influence have greatly diminished. They typicall have jurisdiction over their capital, but not much else. Once, the settlement would bring tithes to the capital, but that just eventually stopped.
	4. How much has human culture preserved? Are we talking about a world with a history close the our own? Human culture continues to exist, and there is a resurgence in the type of the nostalgic culture. A resurgence of traditional clothing with a mix of modern styles has emerged, for instance. Traditions and festivals have varied from oen to the other, or reinterpreted by certain groups. There also has been a resurgence of art: People, who live 
	5. What is the economy like in this world? - Barter EcThere is no saying what someone's medium of currency is - be it solid metal, american dollars, or anything else. 
	6. What makes this world captivating? What does it say about our world? What is it's identity? Tech. everything revolves, ultimately around technolgy. With the turn of progress, there is no turning back the clock. Even whne we don't appreciate it now, it is essntial in everything we live by. 
2. Define particular terms that are essential to this wor
	1. Worldnet(?)
	2. Chapter - 
	3. Settlement 
	4. Gospel(?)
	5. Generic terms, like Intranet, OS, Distro
	6. Tech Stack 
	7. Fab-chapel(?) 
	8. Warforged(?) 
	9. ANd many more
3. Make 3-4 different factions for each group
	1. Mega Corps
	2. Religious Groups
	3. Scavenger Groups 
	4. Tinkerer 'Groups'
	5. Governments 
4. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4gIfNTlv98 Answer these question, repeat step 1-3 if needed. 

After this step, will put this to the githbu, and start the recruiting phase, I think.  





# Lore 
I think the most important part about this project is the lore that we can build around it. I want this aprt to myself, of course, and the way I want to do this is by taking parts of the linux/ BSD community and then try to figure out how I can translate that into some story beat/ history. 

I will also take the DND classes and try to make them feel similar in combat or role while completely reinventing their status and renown in the game, or whatever htis project will bear fruit. 




# Medium 
Currently, the only aim is to get this as a sort of community-driven lore expansion. My primary goal is just a basis for a world where my frienda can play DND in, or maybe some version of SW5e, or Starfinder? 

However, this will probably be intermediary phase, when there is enough of a lore base, to see what we can work with. 





# Mechanics 
These can come later.
