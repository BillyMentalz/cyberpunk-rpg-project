So, the idea is that everything will be resolved at the same time. It doesn't matter which one is going to be killed first. When the actions are taken, 



### Resolving actions 
Actions are taken simulataneously if they occur in the same moment. The initial state of each side is considered rather than the ending state. Suppose, if you will, that one opponent is going running to cover while another is shooting. Both are happening at the same moment, but because the person was out of cover, they are going to take the shots. 

Each action has a certain number of moments before it could be resolved. A rotary machine gun would be a good example. It take a moment to bring out the gun, and another moment to charge the machine gun. It is only the third moment that the machien gun is armed.. Or take, launching missles, for example. You may shoot the missiles in one moment, but it will only land on the enemy in a moment. 

All actions, again, happen at the same time. If you shoot and move in one moemnt, you are doing so simultaneously, which may have buffs or debuffs depending on your skills. All buffs and skills apply only after everyone has declared their actions and done them
