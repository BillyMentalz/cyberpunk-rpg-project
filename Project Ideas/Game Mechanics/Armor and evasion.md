These are the major ways that can either not take damage or not. Each weapon has a damage score and a type 

### Armor 
There can be many sorts of armor. When you have armor, sometimes you simply don't take damage from weapons below a certain damage score. If they get past the damage threshold , tho, then they'll actually do damage 


### Evasion 
YOu can choose to sacrifice all armor for evasion. [[Power-Knights]] by default do not have this ability. 

If you have a passive evasive score, you instead roll to see how much damage you reduce. IF you roll oever, you take no damage.
