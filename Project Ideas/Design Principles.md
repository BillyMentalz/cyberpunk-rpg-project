As I'm slowly putting this out there nad finding other people to help me with this project (someday in the future) I'll probably want to solidfy some desing pirnciples going into writing for this particular RPG. 

# Core system 
There will be elements that are borrowed from other RPGs. Unfortunately, the combat mechancis and character creation will have mnay similarities to DND's 5th edition, due to familiarly, if someone thinks they can make a better system, feel free to fork this project. 
### Wargaming origins
This system is going to use the more simulation side of the TTRPG community to highlight the feel and complexity of different ecosystems and their surrounding technology. 

### Character-specific rest mechanics
Each different class has different ways they rest. In a group where there is a diverse set of classes, tehy all have thieer different ecosystems, because the way we define character is by how they get their tech. A techlock might not really need to rest so much as they get sent a care package as part of their subscription fee. A tech-priest can just go to a fab-temple, and even if they are not of the same chapter, with some configuration, a tech-priest can replenish their stock whenever they run low. 

### Money and upgrading
There should be some system to 


### Strong casuality between the mechanics and the lore
Instead of there having a free-form style of structure, a person's abilities is deeply affected by what class they choose. Each particular feature or ability is implied to have some sort of lore reason to exist.

We don't particularly impart any personality quirks dependin on the class abilities: Normal people usually don't use their technology as part of their personality (sorry Arch users). 

The intent here is blurring the line between the corporate and fantasy. By mixing the reality of design choices with lore, we make the world more believable. 

# Themes 
### The rich history of tech
It is in the consideration of a barely-literate 21-year-old that literature have not cuaght up with the reality of the tech industry. Long past are the ages where a single person makes an invention without standing on the shoulders of several hundred people who each maintain a single part of a cog that make up a complex machine. 

Linux Torvalds did not create the Linux Operating System. He designed the kernel, with the rest of the oeprating system built by the nameless developers at the Free Software Foundation, producing the GNU C library, GNU Core Utilities, GNU Bash shell, GNU Binary Utilities. And thousand more who've created utilites and applications on the operating system. 

Yet it is much in the perception of the masses that stories can only be about great people. Worldbuilding don't give put much stock in the development of tech and how it physically affects our life. From right to repair, to security and privacy. They are things that are not within the purview of the general public and definitely not gamers. 
This book is not going to shy from parallels to real life: Despite it's fantasy-esque settings, practices of open-source projects, tech corporations r sysadmins to integrate alternative solutions. 
### Tech as a substitution for culture 
With the incomprehensible amount we encompass ourselves in technology, is it no wonder that the linux community as a subculture exist? 
It's also the matter where in a post-war world where people cling onto their weapons and their tech for dear life, why wouldn't they define themesvles by how they survived the war? 

### AI and the Enshittification of the internet 
In many fantasy world, there exists an explicit evil, something to give adventurers meaning other than maintaining peace, and allow those in conflict to work together. In DND, it is the residents of the Nine Hells. In this setting, it is the internet, not because of something made for explicitly evil purposes, but because of the degradation of the internet for profitization. A machine so greedy that is kills itself in it's own greed. 

I make no broad statement on AI. They are tools and it is us who define their humanity , or their lack of it. Hence of the existence of the Warforged. 

The reason that this technology is fragmented is three-fold: 1. Establish an unexplored world for a sense of adventure 2. Introduce barriers to information, making in-person conversations as important as improtant as it was centuries ago. 3. Introduce a ever-present evil that cannot be extinguished. 
Rogue AIs tethered to the internet are the servants of masters long dead. They cling to the principles of accumulation and dispossession with reckless abandon, consuming the lives of people to increase nonsensical profit margins by strapping people into their parasitic ecosystem. 
### Nothing more divine than the human spirit 
As men created the evil of this world, so are they architects of the divine. In some fantasy settings, they describe a symbiotic relationship between the gods and mortals, who grow strong from the worship, powers that grow weaker the less they are worshipped. 

Sorry, I have no patience of subtext. Gods are not real here. What people worship here are men before: They honor their ancestors and those who paved the way before. Sigidls are made of 'saints' who've spend their lives maintaining packages that they still use to this day. 
Of course, a person 'dies' when their package is no longer considered useful, their living memory sustained by the next person who wishes to look back at history.
