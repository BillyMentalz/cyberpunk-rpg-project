A savvy is what you get when a person has a grand vision and is brilliant enough to care for themselves using tech. They understand the contraptions on their hands incredibly well and are able to fashion new tools out of nothing.

Only the most foolhardy would set out to become a savvyists. Most will give up after about half a year, and of those remaining, 9 out of 10 are either stranded or dead in 2 years. Only the most capable and the most strong-willed and the most lucky ever make it past a decade. 

While they aren't averse to copying the work of others, as many of their tech *can* be taken from the Chapters, but they might disagree one some ideas and would set out to make their own, and would not rest until they control and know everything. 

Instead of devoting their lives to some greater cause, they devote their lives to proving they are right, and they are the smartest. Having two savvyists in the same room can be miserable. 

But not one turns away a true savvyist who knows what they are doing. They know their way in and out of various fields, from math, physics, biochemistry, they are innovators and early adopters, and much information can be gained if you swallow your pride and listen to their prude lectures.
