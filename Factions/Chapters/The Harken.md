Absolute Minimalist. No GUI, no boilerplate, just pure functionality. The terminal and keybindings are all you need. Learn or perish. 

Absolute maniacs that strive for no bloat at all. There's no 'just in case' with these guys. They pack just the absolute essentails and nothign else, and if you are in a bind, well that's too bad then. You don't need it? Well toss it away. Give it to someone else. If you have things you don't need in the next few weeks then it's bloat. 

Some even go to the lengths of removing parts of their body. For most priests, it's practically a rite of passage to remove the appendix because 'it's unnecessary weight'

### Technology 
Their technology is on par with other chapters, even rivals some of the mega-corps; the only issue is that they see other tech as 'bloated filth' and their tech doesn't work with tech from other sectors at all. Oh you want to use it with your proprietary Lason? Make a compatibility layer yourself. Oh you want to access this terminal? Well it's written in an archaic language. Sorry, you have to make it yourself.
